Welcome to Vishal's MagNet - my first blockchain! 

 how to start the network
 Steps you must follow to experience the entire journey: 

Few initial steps on MyCrytpo: 
 1. Create a wallet, I used a new one just to enjoy the ride! So I went to crypto and I created a wallet using generate wallet. 
 2. I used the Mnemonic phrase to open my new wallet. 
 3. I used a side cheatsheet to track all my work. so I copied the public address of this wallet -> 0x054220BDAb81A1031b6A9B6fAD142aec59B3922d
 4. Next, I went to the "wallet info" tab and I copied the private key on my cheatsheet. (THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT STEP). we will need this key later on when we are mining
